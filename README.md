# status
Right now this is just a copy of the CVS repo asat about 21st July 6pm Czech time (web frontend to that repo here: http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/doas). This is not official or anything it's just a bit of an experiment, so if you're affiliated with OpenBSD and stumble upon this please don't get mad :)
